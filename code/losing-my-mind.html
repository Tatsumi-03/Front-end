                  intro

                  I feel like I'm losing my mind
                  Is everybody in the world blind?
                  Please Lord, give me a sign, a sign
                  I feel like I'm losing my mind
                  Is everybody in the world blind?
                  Please Lord, give me a sign, a sign
                  
                  verse
                  
                  I wanna be the greatest, everybody in the face, yeah
                  Look around, I feel as if everybody is a fakest
                  I make this, every day and I'm impatient
                  Hoping one day, I blow up from the basement
                  Statement, the top is so vacant
                  I don't hear shit that I think is amazing
                  Waiting, for my day when I'm playing
                  Sold out shows for a thousand faces
                  
                  verse
                  
                  Hey, give me that crown
                  Get in my way and you'll be put down
                  It ain't your place, no, this my town
                  If I want that shit, then I will get it right now
                  
                  verse
                  
                  I'm losing it, the noose it fits
                  Some lucid shit, a stupid myth
                  You choose to live or choose to dip
                  You choose to fight or lose your grip
                  And lose a gift, oh
                  
                  chorus
                  
                  I feel like I'm losing my mind
                  Is everybody in the world blind?
                  Please Lord, give me a sign, a sign
                  I feel like I'm losing my mind
                  Is everybody in the world blind?
                  Please Lord, give me a sign, a sign
                  
                  verse
                  
                  Yo, there's no mercy in this world
                  Just hunger, thirsty persons, in different versions
                  Each new update that shit worsens, why?
                  Pull back the curtain
                  And you'll see the different vermin
                  We all have our different burdens
                  That all seem to cause disturbance
                  
                  verse
                  
                  Yo, so do me a favor
                  Don't treat me like a neighbor
                  Don't need the different flavors of your problems just to savor
                  I've got my own issues
                  I need a comb to get through
                  Don't need to groan with you
                  Just go get your own tissues
                  
                  chorus
                  
                  I feel like I'm losing my mind
                  Is everybody in the world blind?
                  Please Lord, give me a sign, a sign
                  I feel like I'm losing my mind
                  Is everybody in the world blind?
                  Please Lord, give me a sign, a sign
                  
                  verse
                  
                  That's it, the end of the song
                  Next time you'll sing along
                  Trust me, there's nothing wrong
                  I just need to carry on, 'cause
                  Society is a myth
                  Put there to make you sit
                  Listen to what they give
                  Don't ask questions, shut your lid
                  
                  verse
                  
                  Yeah, don't ask questions, shut your lid
                  I need to run away from this and go get off the grid
                  Feel like my brain is overloaded
                  Man, I'm losing it
                  Don't let them tell you what to do man
                  They don't know shit
            </pre>
