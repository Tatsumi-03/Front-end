            Hold me close till I get up
            Time is barely on our side
            I don't wanna waste what's left
            The storms we chase are leading us
            And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah
            No, I don't wanna waste what's left
            
            And on and on we'll go
            Through the wastelands, through the highways
            Till my shadow turns to sunrays
            And on and on we'll go
            Through the wastelands, through the highways
            And on and on we'll go
            
            On we'll go
            
            Finding life along the way
            Melodies we haven't played
            No, I don't want no rest
            Echoing around these walls
            Fighting to create a song
            I don't wanna miss a beat
            
            And on and on we'll go
            Through the wastelands, through the highways
            Till my shadow turns to sunrays
            And on and on we'll go
            Through the wastelands, through the highways
            And on and on we'll go
            
            And we'll grow in number
            Fueled by thunder, see the horizon
            Turn us to thousands
            And we'll grow in number
            Fueled by thunder, see the horizon
            Turn us to thousands
            
            And on and on we'll go
            Through the wastelands, through the highways
            Till my shadow turns to sunrays
            And on and on we'll go
            Through the wastelands, through the highways
            And on and on we'll go
